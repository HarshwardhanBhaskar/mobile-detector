# 📱 Mobile Detector

Hi! 👋  
This is my **Mobile Detection Project**, where I built a system that can detect mobile phones in real time using a webcam.

The idea behind this project was to learn how computer vision and deep learning-based object detection work in real-world applications. I used **YOLOv8** for detection and **OpenCV** to handle the camera feed.

## ✨ What this project can do
- Detect mobile phones in a live camera feed  
- Draw bounding boxes around detected phones  
- Show real-time results on the screen

## 🛠️ Technologies I Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8**
- **Pygame**
